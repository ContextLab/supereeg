    "Model objects are superEEG's class that contains the model that reconstructs full brain activity timeseries from a smaller sample of electrodes. The superEEG package offers a few premade models that you can use to reconstruct brain activity, but also a way to create your own model if you have a dataset of intracranial patient data converted into the brain object format.  This tutorial will go over how to use the premade models included in this package, as well as make a new model from scratch."
