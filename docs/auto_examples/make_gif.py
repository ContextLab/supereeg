Make gif
=============================

In this example, we load in a single subject example, remove electrodes that exceed
a kurtosis threshold (in place), load a model, and predict activity at all
model locations.  We then convert the reconstruction to a nifti and plot 3 consecutive timepoints
first with the plot_glass_brain and then create .png files and compile as a gif.
